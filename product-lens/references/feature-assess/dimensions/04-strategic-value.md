# Dimension 4: Strategic Value (战略价值)

**Core question:** Does this feature deepen the app's moat, open revenue paths, or create lock-in -- or is it a commodity addition?

## Universal Sub-Questions

1. **Moat deepening:** Does this feature make the app harder to replicate? (Accumulates user data, encodes domain expertise, creates switching costs)
2. **Revenue path:** Does this feature open or strengthen a monetization path? (Paywall-worthy, premium tier, upsell opportunity)
3. **Network/lock-in effects:** Does more usage of this feature create compounding value? (Data accumulation, content creation, integration depth)
4. **Competitive differentiation:** After adding this feature, is the app more differentiated from competitors, or more similar to them?

## Platform-Specific Sub-Questions

### Default

5. **AI disruption resilience:** Does this feature increase or decrease the app's resilience to AI tools replacing it?

### iOS

> iOS core question variant: Does this feature leverage iOS platform advantages to deepen the moat, or is it a cross-platform commodity feature?

5. **Platform depth leverage:** Does this feature use iOS-exclusive APIs (HealthKit, ARKit, CoreML, App Intents) that make the app harder to replicate on other platforms?
6. **Ecosystem stickiness:** Does this feature increase Apple ecosystem integration (Watch, Mac, iPad, ShareSheet, Siri)? More touch points = higher switching cost.
7. **Apple Intelligence complementarity:** Does this feature complement rather than compete with Apple Intelligence capabilities?

## Evidence Sources

- Local: Existing moat indicators (data accumulation patterns, unique algorithms, domain-specific logic), monetization code, platform API usage
- External: Competitor feature roadmaps, AI tool capabilities in this domain, platform API documentation

## Signal Anchors

| Signal | Anchor |
|--------|--------|
| Positive | Feature deepens moat (data accumulation, unique domain logic); opens or strengthens revenue path; increases competitive differentiation |
| Neutral | Feature is useful but does not significantly change competitive position; commodity addition that competitors also have or could easily add |
| Negative | Feature makes app more similar to competitors (converging); no moat contribution; AI tools could provide equivalent value; maintenance cost without strategic return |
