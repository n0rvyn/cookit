# Dimension 1: Demand Fit (需求契合)

**Core question:** Is there evidence that users of this app want this feature, and what type of need does it address?

## Universal Sub-Questions

1. **Evidence of demand:** What concrete signals exist that users want this? (Support tickets, app reviews, community requests, competitor implementations)
2. **Need classification:** What type of need is this?
   - Table-stakes: users expect it; absence is a complaint
   - Differentiator: users would choose this app over competitors because of it
   - Delight: unexpected, creates positive surprise and word-of-mouth
   - Noise: developer-driven idea without user evidence
3. **Pain in existing journey:** Does the absence of this feature cause measurable friction in the current user journey? Where specifically?
4. **User segment match:** Does the feature serve the app's existing user segment, or does it target a new audience?

## Platform-Specific Sub-Questions

### Default

5. **Alternative workarounds:** Are users currently using workarounds (other tools, manual steps) to accomplish what this feature would do?

### iOS

> iOS core question variant: Do iOS users of this app specifically need this feature, considering iOS platform capabilities and App Store category expectations?

5. **App Store review signals:** Do competitor app reviews mention this feature's absence as a complaint? Do this app's reviews request it?
6. **iOS-native alternatives:** Can Shortcuts, Widgets, ShareSheet, or system features already accomplish what this feature would do?
7. **Category expectation:** Is this feature table-stakes for this App Store category? (Check top 5 competitors in category)

## Evidence Sources

- Local: README feature requests section, CHANGELOG for user-driven changes, issue tracker references in code comments, existing feature list vs proposed feature scope
- External: App Store reviews (for iOS), competitor feature matrices, Reddit/forum discussions about this app category

## Signal Anchors

| Signal | Anchor |
|--------|--------|
| Positive | Multiple independent demand signals (user requests, competitor implementations, review complaints about absence); clear need type identified |
| Neutral | Some indirect signals but no strong direct demand; feature addresses a real scenario but unclear if users prioritize it |
| Negative | No evidence of user demand; developer-driven idea; users have adequate workarounds they seem satisfied with |
