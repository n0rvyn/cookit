# Cookit for Codex

Codex does not use Claude marketplace metadata directly.

Use native Codex skill loading by cloning this repo and linking skill folders.

## Quick Install

Tell Codex:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n0rvyn/cookit/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

## Update

```bash
git -C ~/.codex/cookit pull --ff-only
```

If new skills were added, re-run the symlink step from `.codex/INSTALL.md`.
